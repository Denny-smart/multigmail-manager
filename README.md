Backend

Python 🐍

Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)

OAuth 2.0 (Auth0 & Gmail API integration)

JWT for API authentication

SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)

Frontend

React + TypeScript

Vite (fast dev + build tool)

Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui (UI components)

Infrastructure

RESTful API design

Docker (future deployment scalability)

CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)

🌟 Core Features (MVP)

Multi-Account Authentication

Connect and authenticate multiple Gmail accounts via Google OAuth2.0.

Securely store access & refresh tokens (with encryption).

Unified Inbox

View emails from multiple Gmail accounts in a single dashboard.

Account filters & smart grouping.

HTTPS/TLS enforcement.

📈 Scalability Roadmap

Database Scaling → Switch from SQLite → PostgreSQL → Managed DB (AWS RDS / GCP Cloud SQL).

Microservices Approach → Split email fetching, notifications, and analytics into separate services.

Caching Layer → Redis for faster email queries and notifications.

Background Jobs → Celery + Redis for email syncing and scheduled tasks.

API Gateway → Future integration with multiple providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo).

Cloud Deployment → Docker + Kubernetes for auto-scaling.
